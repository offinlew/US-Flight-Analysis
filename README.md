# USFlightAnalysis

Based on the dataset downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse, flight data between January 2005 and December 2007 from all commercial flights on major airlines across the United States will be analysed using R and Python to answer the following questions:

1.	When is the best time of day, day of week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays? 
2.	Do older planes suffer more delays? 
3.	How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time? 
4.	Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? 
5.	Use the available resources to construct a model that predicts delays. 

The report will showcase programming languages such as R & Python to facilitate the analysis of the data provided. SQL would be used within R & Python using libraries such as DBI from R & sqlite3 from Python to query results from databases created.
